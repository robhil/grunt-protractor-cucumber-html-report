# gulp-protractor-cucumber-html-report

> Generate html report from JSON file returned by CucumberJS json formatter

This is a stand-alone fork of [grunt-protractor-cucumber-html-report](https://github.com/robhil/grunt-protractor-cucumber-html-report)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Gulp `~3.9.0`

If you haven't used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) guide, as it explains how to create a Gulpfile as well as install and use Gulp plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install gulp-protractor-cucumber-html-report --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gulpfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
var reporter = require('gulp-protractor-cucumber-html-report');
```

## The "protractor-cucumber-html-report" task

### Options

#### options.dest
Type: `String`
Default value: `'.'`

The output directory for the HTML report relative from the Gulpfile

#### options.filename
Type: `String`
Default value: `'report.html'`

The filename for the HTML report

### Usage Examples

#### Overview
In your project's Gulpfile, you can use the reporter in your pipeline as follows:

```js
gulp.src('./cucumber-test-results.json')
    .pipe(protractorReport({
        dest: 'reports/'
    }));
```

#### Saving CucumberJS JSON to disk when using Protractor
If you're using Protractor in combination with CucumberJS there currently is [no way](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/90) to save the CucumberJS JSON output to a file.

It is however possible to add a listener to the CucumberJS JSON formatter and save it to a file manually. The following hook can be added to your project and included to your Protractor configuration.

I've added 2 different hooks which basically do the same but one of the 2 requires you to add an extra dependency to your package.json. You're free to choose which one you prefer.

##### Without any extra dependencies

```js
var Cucumber = require('cucumber'),
    fs = require('fs');
    path = require('path');

var JsonFormatter = Cucumber.Listener.JsonFormatter();

var reportDirectory = 'reports/one/two/';
var reportFileName = 'cucumber-test-results.json';

var reportDirectoryPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../', reportDirectory);
var reportFilePath = path.join(reportDirectoryPath, reportFileName);

function mkdirp(path, root) {
  var dirs = path.split('/'), dir = dirs.shift();
  root = (root || '') + dir + '/';

  try {
    fs.mkdirSync(root);
  } catch (e) {
    if(!fs.statSync(root).isDirectory()) throw new Error(e);
  }

  return !dirs.length || mkdirp(dirs.join('/'), root);
}

module.exports = function JsonOutputHook() {
  JsonFormatter.log = function (json) {
    fs.open(reportFilePath, 'w+', function (err, fd) {
      if (err) {
        mkdirp(reportDirectoryPath);
        fd = fs.openSync(reportFilePath, 'w+');
      }

      fs.writeSync(fd, json);

      console.log('json file location: ' + reportFilePath);
    });
  };

  this.registerListener(JsonFormatter);
};

```

##### With the fs-extra dependency

If you're going for this implementation, be sure to add fs-extra(https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) to your package.json in order for this to work.

```js
var Cucumber = require('cucumber');
    fs = require('fs-extra');
    path = require('path');

var JsonFormatter = Cucumber.Listener.JsonFormatter();

var reportsDir = path.join(__dirname, '../../reports');
var reportFile = path.join(reportsDir, 'cucumber-test-results.json');

module.exports = function JsonOutputHook() {
  JsonFormatter.log = function (json) {
    fs.open(reportFile, 'w+', function (err, fd) {
      if (err) {
        fs.mkdirsSync(reportsDir);
        fd = fs.openSync(reportFile, 'w+');
      }

      fs.writeSync(fd, json);

      console.log('json file location: ' + reportFile);
    });
  };

  this.registerListener(JsonFormatter);
};
```

Both 2 snippets above will hook into the CucumberJS JSON formatter and save the JSON to a file called 'cucumber-test-results.json' in the '../../reports' folder (relative from this file's location)

#### Setting up Protractor, CucumberJS and the JSON listener

In your protractor.conf.js add a reference to the hook listener (as shown above). In this example the file is found in './support'. Also make sure to set the output format to 'json'.

```js
cucumberOpts: {
  require: ['steps/*.js', 'support/*.js'],
  format: 'json'
},
```

#### Screenshot support for failing scenarios

Adding screenshots of failing scenarios to the HTML report requires you to add an After hook. This can be easily achieved by creating a Javascript file with the following content:

```js
module.exports = function TakeScreenshot() {
    this.After(function (scenario, callback) {
        if (scenario.isFailed()) {
            browser.takeScreenshot().then(function (png) {
                var decodedImage = new Buffer(png, 'base64').toString('binary');
                scenario.attach(decodedImage, 'image/png');

                callback();
            });
        } else {
            callback();
        }
    });
};
```

If you're using the cucumberOpts as shown in *Setting up Protractor, CucumberJS and the JSON listener* then all you need to do is save this to a Javascript file in the 'support/' folder. Otherwise you have to change the cucumberOpts require property to load your hook.

This is all that's required to add the saved screenshots to the HTML report.
